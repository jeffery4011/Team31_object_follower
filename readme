Deliverable: Package
Functionality: Robot turns in place following an object
Architecture:
Package Team31_object_follower
	Node find_object
		(subscribes to /raspicam_node/image/compressed)
		(publishes pixel coord of object)
	Node rotate_robot
		(subscribes to object coordinate messages from find_object)
		(publishes velocity messages to cmd_vel)

I have additionally written a test_publisher.py file which sends Point type messages on
topic "/obj_coord". This is a test harness for rotate_robot.py

STEPS FOR RUNNING ON BURGERBOT

(FROM LAPTOP)copy package directory to burger using:
	scp -r <Directory on your cpu to copy> burger@<ip-of-burger>:<Directory to copy to on robot>
